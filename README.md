## Inspiration

The theme for VandyHack 2023 is "Neon." This theme inspired us to brainstorm ideas related to Neon. We initially thought about topics associated with night time and relaxation, and this led us to explore ways to unwind during our free time. As a result, we came up with the name "NeOff."

To create something accessible to a wide audience and recognizing that many people spend their leisure time on the internet, we decided to develop a web extension. This extension is designed to help users discover entertaining websites to pass the time and relax.

To align with the Neon theme, we designed the user interface to feature a neon light effect. The UI incorporates a dark background and vibrant colors, with CSS techniques that emulate light flickering and glowing. This design captures the essence of neon lights, creating a visually captivating and immersive experience for users.
